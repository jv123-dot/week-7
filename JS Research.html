Differences between var, let and const:
Var is function level and as a result has a much wider scope and can be reassigned
Let and const are both block level and only accessible within the block they are assigned.
Let can be reassigned while const cannot.

What are the differences between callbacks and promises:
Promises have built in error handing and are more readable, however due to them being a newer edition might have
less support.
Callbacks do not have built in error handling and can be harder to read if too many callbacks are nested
